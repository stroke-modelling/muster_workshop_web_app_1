# Mobile stroke unit scenario explorer

This model shows predicted outcomes for non-large vessel occlusion (nLVO) and large vessel occlusion 
stroke. Outcomes are calculated for 34,000 small areas (LSOAs) across England based on expected 
travel times, and other timing parameters chosen by the slider bars on the right.

More detail may be found on estimation of stroke outcomes [here](https://samuel-book.github.io/stroke_outcome/intro.html). 

The reported outcomes are for treated patients (they do not include patients unsuitable for treatment, 
haemorrhagic strokes, or mimics)

## Pathways

Three pathways are modelled, through to thrombectomy (note: thrombectomy is only applied to large 
vessel occlusions; non-large vessel occlusions are treated with thrombolysis only). The three pathways are:

1) *Drip-and-ship*: All patients are taken to their closest emergency stroke unit, all of which 
provide thrombolysis. For patients who receive thrombectomy there is a transfer to a thrombectomy-capable 
if the patient has first attended a hopsital that provides thrombolysis only.

2) *Mothership*: All patients are taken to a comprehensive stroke centre that can provide both 
thrombolysis and thrombectomy.

3) *Mobile stroke unit (MSU)*: MSUs are dispatched, from comprehensive stroke centres, to stroke patients. 
Head scans and thrombolysis are provided on-scene, where the patient is. For patients who have been 
treated with thrombolysis or considered suitable for thrombectomy, the MSU takes the patient to the 
comprehensive stroke centre. Where a patient does not receive thrombolysis, and is not considered 
a candidate for thrombectomy, the MSU becomes available for another stroke patient, and a standard 
ambulance conveys the patient to the closest emergency stroke unit. In this particular model there 
are no capacity limits for the MSU, and it is assumed all strokes are triaged correctly with the 
emergency call - the model shows outcomes if all patients were seen by a MSU.
